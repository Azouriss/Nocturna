# 🕶️ Project Noctura (working title)

**Noctura** is an encrypted, local-first, autonomous messaging system designed for anonymity, security, and resilience.  
No sign-ups, no central servers, no shared data. Just you, your machine, and an encrypted tunnel to your contacts.

> **Disclaimer**: This project is currently in alpha development. Its goal is to offer a free, independent, and privacy-respecting open source solution.

## ✨ Goals

- 💬 **Private, direct messaging**, without central servers
- 🔐 **End-to-end encryption** using modern and hybrid algorithms
- 🕳️ **Anonymous connectivity** via a distributed network
- 🎭 **Advanced obfuscation** of communications
- 🧱 **Modular structure**, extensible and portable

---

## 🚀 How It Works (high-level)

1. When launched, the application:

   - Automatically configures its secure environment
   - Generates a local encrypted identity
   - Connects to a distributed, encrypted network

2. Messages are:

   - Encrypted locally
   - Transmitted through anonymized layers
   - Decrypted only by the legitimate recipient

3. Metadata is:
   - Minimal to non-existent
   - Masked through multiple obfuscation techniques
